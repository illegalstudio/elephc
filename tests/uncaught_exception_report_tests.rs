//! Purpose:
//! End-to-end tests for the fatal diagnostic an UNCAUGHT `throw` prints, and the process exit
//! status that follows it.
//!
//! Before this, every uncaught exception — of any class, with any message — printed one fixed
//! 32-byte string and exited `1`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Fatal error: uncaught exception
//! ```
//!
//! The class and the message were both discarded, so a production crash told you nothing about
//! what had been thrown. `_exc_value` already held the Throwable at that point
//! (`lower_throw_value` publishes it immediately before `__rt_throw_current`); the uncaught arm
//! simply never read it.
//!
//! Reference PHP 8.5.6, measured with `php -d xdebug.mode=off`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Fatal error: Uncaught RuntimeException: boom detail in /path/e.php:2
//! Fatal error: Uncaught MyErr: custom text in /path/m2.php:3
//! Fatal error: Uncaught Exception in /path/m1.php:2        <- EMPTY message: no colon
//! ```
//!
//! elephc now emits the full report PHP does: the class, the message, the ` in <file>:<line>`
//! suffix, the `Stack trace:` block (one `#n file(line): call(args)` line per live frame and the
//! closing `#n {main}`), the `Next ...` chain of previous exceptions, the closing
//! `  thrown in <file> on line <n>` line, and exits `255` like PHP.
//!
//! Two framing details were measured later, from RAW BYTES rather than from the message text, and
//! both had gone unnoticed because reading a merged `2>&1` hides them:
//!
//! - PHP prefixes the report with `\n`, UNCONDITIONALLY — even when the script has written
//!   nothing at all before throwing.
//! - PHP writes it to STDOUT. Captured into separate files, stdout held every byte and stderr was
//!   empty. A program redirecting only stdout used to lose the diagnostic entirely.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test --test uncaught_exception_report_tests` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - THE LOCATION IS THE CONSTRUCTION SITE, NOT THE THROW SITE, because that is what PHP reports:
//!   a `new RuntimeException(...)` on line 2 stored in a variable and thrown on line 5 prints
//!   line 2 in both engines. The line is stamped into the Throwable payload when it is allocated,
//!   which is precisely the `new`; `separates_construction_from_throw_site` is the test that would
//!   fail if the line were taken from the `throw` instead, and it is the only one of these tests
//!   where the two differ.
//! - THE STACK TRACE is rendered from the live activation chain at report time. The tests that
//!   exercise it compare the WHOLE output against reference PHP 8.5 text and, when a `php` binary
//!   is on the PATH, against what that binary prints for the very same script. The chain test
//!   keeps both exceptions in one frame on purpose: PHP captures each trace at construction, elephc
//!   walks the frames live at the uncaught throw, so a previous exception built in a callee that
//!   has since returned prints a shorter trace (a documented divergence, not pinned here).
//! - A Throwable with NO user `new` behind it — a `DivisionByZeroError` raised by `intdiv($n, 0)`
//!   — carries line `0`, and the suffix is omitted entirely rather than printed as `:0`.
//!   `synthesized_error_omits_the_location_and_still_exits_255` pins both halves of that: the
//!   omission, and the exit status, which travels a SEPARATE code path
//!   (`codegen::lower_inst::exceptions`) that never reaches `__rt_report_uncaught_exception`.
//! - The EXIT STATUS is asserted separately from the text. It moved from `1` to `255`; a script
//!   that branched on `$?` saw the wrong value before, and that is invisible in stdout/stderr.
//! - The empty-message case is the one that would silently pass with a naive implementation:
//!   writing `": "` unconditionally still looks right in every other test.
//! - A USER SUBCLASS is covered because the class name comes from the runtime
//!   `_class_name_entries` table rather than a compile-time literal, so a name that only exists in
//!   user code is the case that proves the table lookup works.
//! - Host-target only in execution; the emitter change is pinned on both architectures by the unit
//!   tests in `src/codegen_support/runtime/exceptions/uncaught_report.rs`.
