//! Purpose:
//! Integration or regression tests for end-to-end codegen coverage of control flow nulls, including ternary null is falsy.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Inline PHP fixtures are compiled to native binaries and assertions compare stdout or expected failures.
