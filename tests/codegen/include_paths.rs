//! Purpose:
//! Integration or regression tests for end-to-end codegen coverage of include paths, including include with dunder dir concat, include with const ref, and include with define ref.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Multi-file fixtures exercise include/require resolution, temporary project layout, and native binary output.

// `require __DIR__ . '/...';` is the most common idiomatic include pattern
// in PHP. After magic-constant substitution, __DIR__ becomes a string literal
// and the resolver's path folder concatenates it with the trailing literal.

/// Verifies `require __DIR__ . '/lib/inner.php'` works after magic-constant
/// substitution. `__DIR__` is lowered to a string literal by the magic-constants
/// pass; the resolver then concatenates it with the trailing literal to produce
/// the resolved include path.
