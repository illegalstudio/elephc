//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `link` builtin: its declaration and lowering.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - The builtin registry (declaration) and the EIR backend (lower hook),
//!   both via `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - No `check` hook: `link` is a pure-data builtin whose `Bool` return type is
//!   fully determined by its declaration. The registry common path infers the
//!   arguments and enforces the exactly-2-argument arity before falling back to
//!   `returns`.
//! - `lower` is a thin wrapper over `io::lower_link` in the EIR backend.
