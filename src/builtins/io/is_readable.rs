//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `is_readable` builtin: its declaration and lowering.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - The builtin registry (declaration) and the EIR backend (lower hook),
//!   both via `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - No `check` hook is needed: `is_readable` is a pure-data builtin whose return
//!   type (`Bool`) is fully determined by its declaration. The registry common path
//!   infers the argument and enforces arity before falling back to `returns`.
//! - `lower` is a thin wrapper over `io::lower_is_readable` in the EIR backend.
