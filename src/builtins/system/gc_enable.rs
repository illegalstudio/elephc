//! Purpose:
//! Registers PHP's `gc_enable` control builtin for ahead-of-time programs.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Elephc's native ownership runtime is always active, so enabling collection is an idempotent no-op.
