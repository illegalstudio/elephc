//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `gmdate` builtin: its declaration and lowering.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - The builtin registry (declaration) and the EIR backend (lower hook),
//!   both via `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - No `check` hook is needed: `gmdate` is a pure-data builtin whose return type
//!   (`Str`) is fully determined by its declaration. The `timestamp` parameter
//!   is optional and defaults to `null` (current time).
