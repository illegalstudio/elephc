//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `strrev` builtin and its backend-neutral runtime semantics.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - The builtin registry, checker, optimizer, and AST-to-EIR builtin lowering path.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The typed runtime target has a validated `Str -> Str` EIR signature.
//! - Concrete helper symbols and registers are selected only by the target backend.
