//! Purpose:
//! Resolves individual include and require statements during resolver traversal.
//! Parses target files, handles include_once state, and merges resolved included statements.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::resolver::engine::resolve_stmts()`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Include paths are folded in the caller's constant state and file base directory.

/// Resolves a single include/require statement by parsing the target file,
/// recursively resolving its statements, and returning them wrapped in
/// appropriate include_once guards.
///
/// - `once`: when true, skips already-included files and wraps output in `IncludeOnceGuard`
/// - `required`: when true, returns an error if the target file does not exist
/// - `declared_once`: tracks files already processed; updated on return
/// - `include_chain`: current include path for cycle detection; must not contain `canonical`
/// - State (`namespace`, `const_imports`) is saved before recursion and restored after
/// - Returns `None` if the file does not exist and `required` is false, or if a once file was already included
/// - For `once`: wraps body in `IncludeOnceGuard` with the file's label
/// - For non-once: emits `IncludeOnceMark` before the body for later once/require_once checks
